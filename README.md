# List of Invasive Alien Species of Union concern

## Rationale

<!-- This section gives a quick description of what this repository is for. At least update the "... the data of (blank) ..." or edit as you see fit. -->

This repository contains the functionality to standardize the data of _List of Invasive Alien Species of Union concern_ to a [Darwin Core checklist](https://www.gbif.org/dataset-classes) that can be harvested by [GBIF](http://www.gbif.org).

## Workflow

[source data](data/raw) â†’ Darwin Core [mapping script](src/dwc_mapping.Rmd) â†’ generated [Darwin Core files](data/processed)

## Published dataset

<!-- This section provides links to the published dataset. Obviously, you'll only be able to add those links once you have published your dataset. ðŸ˜‹ -->

* [Dataset on the IPT](<!-- Add the URL of the dataset on the IPT here -->)
* [Dataset on GBIF](<!-- Add the DOI of the dataset on GBIF here -->)
