# List of Invasive Alien Species of Union concern

## Rationale

This repository contains the functionality to standardize the data of the [List of Invasive Alien Species of Union concern](https://ec.europa.eu/environment/nature/invasivealien/list/index_en.htm) to a [Darwin Core Archive](https://www.gbif.org/darwin-core) that can be harvested by [GBIF](https://www.gbif.org/).

## Workflow

[source data](https://github.com/riparias/union-list/tree/main/data/raw) â†’ Darwin Core [mapping script](https://riparias.github.io/union-list/dwc_mapping.html) â†’ generated [Darwin Core files](https://github.com/riparias/union-list/tree/main/data/processed)

The source data are manually created from:

- [2022 consolidated version pdf](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:02016R1141-20220802&from=EN): scientific names with authors, synonym names (in parenthesis) with authors
- spreadsheets containing common names: [first version](https://circabc.europa.eu/ui/group/4cd6cb36-b0f1-4db4-915e-65cd29067f49/library/2ed2ee2a-730f-4583-a3ac-bb2a1815ad6a/details) (January 2018) and later additions ([April 2020](https://circabc.europa.eu/ui/group/4cd6cb36-b0f1-4db4-915e-65cd29067f49/library/1ac00d12-613b-447c-ab91-3016af071bcf/details) and [January 2022](https://circabc.europa.eu/ui/group/4cd6cb36-b0f1-4db4-915e-65cd29067f49/library/fad036d3-e2df-4adb-9c7a-7b9593a4c2f8/details))
