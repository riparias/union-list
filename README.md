# List of Invasive Alien Species of Union concern

## Rationale

This repository contains the functionality to standardize the data of the [List of Invasive Alien Species of Union concern](https://ec.europa.eu/environment/nature/invasivealien/list/index_en.htm) to a [Darwin Core Archive](https://www.gbif.org/darwin-core) that can be harvested by [GBIF](https://www.gbif.org/).

## Workflow

[source data](data/raw) â†’ Darwin Core [mapping script](src/dwc_mapping.Rmd) â†’ generated [Darwin Core files](data/processed)

The source data are manually created from:

- [2022 consolidated version pdf](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:02016R1141-20220802&from=EN): scientific names with authors, synonym names (in parenthesis) with authors
- [web page](https://ec.europa.eu/environment/nature/invasivealien/list/index_en.htm): English name, entry into force, kingdom (table headers)

## Published dataset

<!-- This section provides links to the published dataset. Obviously, you'll only be able to add those links once you have published your dataset. ðŸ˜‹ -->

* [Dataset on the IPT](https://ipt.inbo.be/resource?r=union-list)
* [Dataset on GBIF](<!-- Add the DOI of the dataset on GBIF here -->)
